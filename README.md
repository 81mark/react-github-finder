**Learning how to make react app with an api and using a node/express proxy!**

## Update

### Proxy is now hosted in a different central location.

Can still use the proxy on localhost and left it here for example.

**Based upon Brad Traversy's Modern JS course. (_Big thanks Brad, your tutorials help me out a lot!_)**

_Ported it from vanilla JS to React and added a proxy server to keep the API details safer._
_Any other security tips welcome as I am trying to figure out security as I learn on the go_
